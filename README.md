# Mutsuki framework

This is the framework that I used for RainyXeon/ByteBlaze discord bot. Inspired by Adivise/NanoSpace (Im not based in that).

# Install

```
npm i
// You can use "pnpm i" also
```

# Run bot

```
// Dev:
npm run dev
// Start:
npm run build:full
npm start
```

# Build bot

```
node build.mjs clean
node build.mjs build

// And you will have build file on /out dir
// If u want to direct build, here is the command:
npm run build:full
```

# Commands

Check the `/src/commands` dir

# Optional

You can change version in "/src/manifest.xml"
